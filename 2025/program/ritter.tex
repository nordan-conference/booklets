\talk{Tyson Ritter}{A Rudin-Carleson theorem with Runge approximation for maps into Oka manifolds}
{%
    Given a closed set $E \subset \partial {\mathbb D}$ of measure
    zero and a continuous function $\varphi: E \to {\mathbb C}$, the
    classical Rudin-Carleson theorem states that there exists a
    continuous function $F : \overline {\mathbb D} \to {\mathbb C}$
    that is holomorphic on ${\mathbb D}$ and satisfies
    $F|_E = \varphi$. In this talk I will present a
    generalisation of the Rudin-Carleson theorem for maps into Oka
    manifolds that additionally includes approximation on compact
    subsets $K \subset {\mathbb D}$ without any holes and
    interpolation at a point $c \in {\mathbb D}$. This is joint work
    in progress with Benedikt Magn√∫sson (University of Iceland).
