\talk{Jouni Rättyä}{Carleson measures for Bergman spaces}
{%
    A positive Borel measure $\mu$ on the unit disc is called the
    $q$-Carleson measure for the Bergman space $A^p_\omega$ if
    the idenity mapping from $A^p_\omega$ to the Lebesgue space
    $L^q_\mu$ is bounded. In this talk we give an overview of these
    measures in the case when $\omega$ is a radial doubling weight
    in the unit disc and show a number of applications of these
    measures. At the end of the talk we pose a few open problems
    related to the less understood case of non-radial weights.
