\talk{Arkadiusz Lewandowski}{Exposing type results for smoothly bounded (strictly)\\pseudoconvex domains}
{%
    It is well known that every boundary point of a strictly
    pseudoconvex domain admits an exposing mapping. We shall discuss
    the difficulties, possibilities, and tools that appear when
    trying to extend this kind of result beyond the class of
    strictly pseudoconvex smoothly bounded domains.
