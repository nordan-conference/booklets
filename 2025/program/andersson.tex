\talk{Mats Andersson}{Singular metrics on holomorphic vector bundles}
{%
    Let $E\to X$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over a complex
    manifold $X$. I will discuss how one can define Chern form,
    Segre form and curvature tensor, associated with a class of
    singular metrics on $E$. I will also present some recent results
    in joint works in progress with Kalm, Lärkäng, and Sera.
