\talk{Finnur Lárusson}{Holomorphic and algebraic immersed curves directed by a flexible cone}
{%
    I will describe recent joint work with Antonio Alarcón
    (Crelle 2025) and Alarcón and Franc Forstnerrič (arXiv 2024).
    We investigate immersed complex curves in complex affine space,
    directed by a cone $A$ satisfying one of the flexibility
    properties that are studied in Oka theory. When $A$ is the
    so-called null quadric, such curves play a fundamental role in
    the theory of minimal surfaces. There are other important
    examples.  We are interested in approximation and interpolation
    theory for such curves, as well as the ``rough shape'' of the
    space of all curves. I will review results from 5-10 years ago
    in the holomorphic case and then describe our recent results in
    the algebraic setting, where obstacles not present in the
    holomorphic case arise.
