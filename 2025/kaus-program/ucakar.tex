    Carleman approximation without critical points
}
{%
    The classical Carleman approximation theorem states that any
    complex-valued continuous function on the real line can be
    approximated by an entire holomorphic function, such that their
    difference along the real line is bounded by a positive
    continuous error function. Closed sets in open Riemann surfaces
    that enjoy this property are called Carleman sets, and they were
    first characterised by A. Boivin in 1986. It turns out that
    under some additional assumptions, one can require that the
    approximating global function has no critical points. The plan
    for the talk is to present this result and provide a quick
    sketch of the proof.
