    Multipole phenomena for the two-component plasma
}
{%
    I will describe a work in progress together with Ludvig
    Svensson. We study the two component plasma in two dimensions, a
    well-studied model in mathematical physics describing positive
    and negatively charged particles in two dimensions with
    logarithmic interaction. In particular we are interested in the
    conjectural occurence of dipoles and multipoles at low
    temperature, that is, neutral clusters of particles. To do this
    we use classical methods of complex analysis and algebraic
    geometry such as the Bernstein-Atiyah-Gelfand analytic
    continuation of complex powers and the Fulton-MacPherson
    compactification of configuration spaces.
