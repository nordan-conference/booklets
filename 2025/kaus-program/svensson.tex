    Consider a system of $N$ point particles at positions
    $p_1, \dots, p_N$ on the $2$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$
    that interact according to the \emph{Coulomb potential}
    \[
        E = \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq N}c_{i,j}\log\|p_i - p_j\|^2,
    \]
    where $c_{i,j}$ is a symmetric matrix of real coupling constants,
    describing the strength (and sign) of interaction between
    particle $i$ and particle $j$.
    In joint work together with Rolf Andreasson, we use tools from
    Complex and Algebraic geometry to study the
    \emph{Gibbs measure} and associated
    \emph{partition function} of this system in thermal
    equilibrium at inverse temperature $\beta$. We show that the
    critical inverse temperature(s), where the partition function
    diverges, are solution(s) to a certain discrete optimization
    problem.
