    The Diederich-Forn√¶ss worm domain, constructed as the first
    smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain without a Stein
    neighbourhood basis, is a key counterexample in Several
    Complex Variables. In this talk, we examine its automorphism
    group in both bounded and unbounded cases and demonstrate that
    its boundary is locally spherical everywhere except at the
    exceptional locus and the caps.
