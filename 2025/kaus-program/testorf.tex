    Ohsawa Takegoshi and geodesics in the space of Kähler metrics
}
{%
    I will discuss an Ohsawa takegoshi $L^2$ extension result which
    associates an estimate to a $\mathbb C^*$ degeneration of a
    Kähler manifold. In particular, I will focus on the estimates
    when the metrics along this degeneration are associated to
    geodesic rays in the space of Kähler metrics. The main example
    here will be the deformation to the tangent bundle. This is
    joint work with Yan He and Xu Wang.
