    We present results describing the degeneration process of the
    boundary of the Milnor fiber of a holomorphic function $f$ into
    the link of the analytic set defined by the critical values of
    $f$. These results address both the case where $f$ has an
    isolated singularity at the origin and the case where the origin
    is a non-isolated singular point.
