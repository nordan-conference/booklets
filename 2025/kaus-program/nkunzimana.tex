    Holomorphic matrices -- an argument principle
}
{%
    Suppose $f$ is a matrix of holomorphic functions in several
    variables. If $f$ is surjective outside the origin, one can define
    the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity of $f$, generalising the order of
    vanishing of a single variable function. We show that we get a
    representation of the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity as a product of
    a smooth form and a residue current. This can be seen as an
    argument principle for holomorpic matrices, and it generalises a
    result of Andersson, where row matrices were considered, as well
    as a previous result of the speaker, where direct sums of row
    matrices were considered.
