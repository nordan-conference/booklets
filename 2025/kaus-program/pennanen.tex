    Carleson measures for Bergman-Zygmund spaces\\induced by doubling weights
}
{%
    In this talk, we consider generalized weighted Bergman-Zygmund
    spaces induced by doubling weights and generalized
    Lebesgue-Zygmund spaces induced by positive Borel measures. We
    begin by showing some basic properties of a certain class of
    inducing functions and of doubling weights. Then, we give a
    characterization for when the identity operator from the
    weighted Bergman-Zygmund spaces to the Lebesgue-Zygmund spaces
    is bounded or compact. The talk is based on joint work with
    H.~R.~Cho, H.~Koo, Y.~J.~Lee, J.~Rättyä and F.~Wu.
