    Hankel forms and operators induced by measures
}
{%
    This talk explores the boundedness of bilinear Hankel forms and
    Hankel operators within weighted Bergman spaces, where the
    weights satisfy an upper-doubling condition. We will also
    discuss the connection of these operators to Hankel measures.
    Our goal is to characterize $p$-Hankel measures for $p \leq 2$,
    using duality and factorization techniques from weighted Bergman
    spaces, along with recent results on two-weight fractional
    derivatives.
