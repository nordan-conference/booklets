    Schlichtness of the envelope for truncated tube\\domains in higher complex dimension
}
{%
    We consider the notion of envelope of holomorphy of a domain
    in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and discuss the schlichtness of it by reviewing
    some known results. Next by addressing two motivating
    questions for research we introduce the notion of good
    barrier, augmenting function and compact fence. Then we
    discuss a generalization of a theorem by Jarnicki-Pflug in
    higher complex dimension for good domains. This includes the
    schlichtness of the envelope for truncated tube domains in
    higher complex dimension. Finally we state some open
    questions in this direction.
