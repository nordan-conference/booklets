    Fast Bellman algorithm for real Monge-Ampere equation
}
{%
    In this talk I will introduce a new numerical algorithm solving
    the Dirichlet problem for real Monge-Ampere equation. The
    algorithm is based on Bellman's principle which enables to
    solve our fully non-linear elliptic Monge-Ampere equation by
    approximating it with a sequence of linear elliptic differential
    equations. Further, I will discuss the strengths and weaknesses
    of the method whilst demonstrating its performance on many
    examples of various degrees of degeneracy as well as compare its
    efficiency with two other numerical methods, which emerges to be
    3-10 times faster for smooth, convex examples and 20-100 times
    (or even more) faster for mildly degenerate examples.
